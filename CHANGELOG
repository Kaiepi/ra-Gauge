Revision history for Gauge

v0.0.1:
    - Initial release.

v0.0.2:
    - Update copyright year.

v0.0.3:
    - Add source URL to META6.json.

v0.0.4:
    - Rename Gauge's iterators' raw methods to gc for consistency with the $!gc
      getter on Gauge.

v0.0.5:
    - Correct outdated comment in the README.

v1.0.0:
    - GC is eliminated from the time library altogether. Its absense is
      primarily responsible for any jump in polls, though this may not persist
      and may produce large drops in numbers sometimes compared to with GC.
    - Gauge.new now types one Gauge::Iterator:D $it.
    - Gauge::Iterator now carries stubs for time-one, pull-one, skip-one, and
      sink-all "getters". skip-one must return True, while the rest are untyped.
    - Gauge::It no longer exposes its block.
    - Gauge::Poller is now a true class equivalent to Gauge::Poller::Raw prior.
    - Gauge::Poller::Raw and Gauge::Poller::Collected have been removed.
    - Gauge::Throttler now includes its throttle in the time it takes to
      perform an iteration via time-one, which Gauge::Poller solely depends on.
    - Gauge::Covenant, a thread that can process commands defined by
      Gauge::Iterator, is introduced.
    - Gauge::Contract, a container for a list of iterators to be processed in
      parallel, is introduced.
    - Gauge.pledge, a method for spanning a gauged iterator across multiple
      threads, is introduced.
    - A practical benchmark has been included in the README.

v1.0.1:
    - Don't demand the existence of nqp::isge_u for a uint64 comparison.
